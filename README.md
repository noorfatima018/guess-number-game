# 🎲 Dice Game

A fun, interactive two-player dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

## 🕹️ Gameplay Rules

- Two players take turns rolling a die.
- Each roll adds to the **current score** unless the player rolls a `1`, which ends their turn and resets their current score to `0`.
- Players can **hold** their score to add the current score to their **total score** and end their turn.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game!
